# pneumonia_detection_from_chest_xrays

*This repo is for personal use only.* 

**Note:** 

* The dataset is quite large (over 1GB) and is not uploaded to this GitHub repo. If you wish to run the notebook code blocks locally after cloning this repo, download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data and put it in "./data/".
* The weights of our trained model in .hdf5 format is over 100 MB and is over the resctriction if size/file limitation in GitHub, and is therefore not uploaded. If you execute the 'build_and_train_model.ipynb' locally you will have the weights stored as './xray_class_my_model.best.hdf5'
