    "**Seems like we were able to get some predictions from our trained network. Detecting Pneumonia is hard even for experienced radiologists so it is okay if our model is not perfect. One thing to notice is that test6.dcm does not have the correct Patient Position attribute that our model was trained on. Even though it looks similar to what we were expecting from 'AP' or 'PA' positioned patients, it's better that we do not use our model to make any inference on it. And we can see that our model confuses itself with pneumonia and effusion, which is quite common in a clinical setting since the distinct features of effusion and pneumonia are quite similar.**"
